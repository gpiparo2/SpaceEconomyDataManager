## Core Modules

### DataDownload

**Module:** `SatelliteDataManager/core/data_download.py`

- **Purpose:**  
  Handles the downloading of satellite imagery from Sentinel Hub.  
- **Key Features:**  
  - API authentication via client credentials.  
  - Setup of evalscripts (JavaScript code) for different satellites.  
  - Input validation and GeoJSON parsing to extract bounding boxes.  
  - Downloading images over specified time intervals for multiple satellites.

Refer to the docstrings in the code for detailed information on methods such as `authenticate_api()`, `set_evalscripts()`, `download_images()`, and `download_interval()`.

### DataManipulator

**Module:** `SatelliteDataManager/core/data_manipulator.py`

- **Purpose:**  
  Organizes and renames downloaded TIFF files.
- **Key Features:**  
  - Renames files using a standardized naming convention (area_satellite_fromDate_toDate.tiff).  
  - Organizes files into folders by satellite type.  
  - Prepares datasets for further processing by assembling spectral bands and associated masks.  
  - Exports data to CSV or compressed NPZ formats.

Detailed instructions for methods like `manipulate_data()`, `prepare_spectral_bands_dataset_list()`, and `store_data_as_csv()` are available in the docstrings.

### DatasetPreparation

**Module:** `SatelliteDataManager/core/dataset_preparation.py`

- **Purpose:**  
  Prepares TFRecord datasets for machine learning by processing organized satellite data.
- **Key Features:**  
  - Loading TIFF images and extracting metadata.  
  - Applying GeoJSON masks to images.  
  - Computing global quantiles for normalization.  
  - Cropping images into non-overlapping patches.  
  - Data augmentation methods for generating rotations and reflections.  
  - Serialization of sensor data and labels into TFRecord examples.

Consult the docstrings for functions such as `load_image()`, `apply_geojson_mask()`, `compute_global_quantiles()`, `global_normalize_image()`, `crop_image_to_patches()`, and `parse_dataset()`.

### DataVisualizer

**Module:** `SatelliteDataManager/core/data_visualizer.py`

- **Purpose:**  
  Provides utility functions to visualize satellite images and inspect TFRecord datasets.
- **Key Features:**  
  - Display single images or multi-band grids (with RGB composites).  
  - Apply polygon masks and calculate vegetation indices (NDVI).  
  - Inspect and visualize the contents of TFRecord files, including DEM data.
- **Special Note:**  
  The function `inspect_and_visualize_custom_tfrecord()` now supports visualizing DEM data and prints the label if it is a scalar.

### SDM

**Module:** `SatelliteDataManager/core/sdm.py`

- **Purpose:**  
  Acts as a wrapper to initialize and provide direct access to all core modules.
- **Key Features:**  
  - Instantiates and holds instances of DataDownload, DataManipulator, DataVisualizer, and DatasetPreparation.
  - Enables users to call functions directly via attributes like `sdm.data_downloader`, `sdm.data_manipulator`, etc.

## Analyses Modules

### Burned Area Segmentation

**Module:** `SatelliteDataManager/analyses/burned_area/custom_dataset_builder.py`

- **Purpose:**  
  Builds a custom TFRecord dataset for burned area (fire) segmentation.
- **Key Features:**  
  - Reads activation-specific sensor image files from organized folders.  
  - Applies a temporal sampling strategy:
    - Sentinel-2 & Sentinel-1: 3 time steps (first, median, last).
    - Sentinel-3-OLCI & Sentinel-3-SLSTR-Thermal: one image per day.
    - DEM: the central image.
  - Computes a binary label mask from a fire GeoJSON file.
  - Offers optional preprocessing such as normalization, masking, and cropping (with patch extraction).
  - Serializes all sensor data and metadata into TFRecord examples.
- **Usage Tip:**  
  For detailed instructions on obtaining activation data (e.g., from the Copernicus Emergency Management Service), refer to the [CEMS website](https://emergency.copernicus.eu/).

### Vineyard Classification

**Module:** `SatelliteDataManager/analyses/vineyard/custom_dataset_builder.py`

- **Purpose:**  
  Builds a custom TFRecord dataset for vineyard classification.
- **Key Features:**  
  - Reads vineyard information from GeoJSON files containing the polygon and the `"Classe"` property.
  - Downloads satellite imagery for the vineyard area using a specified temporal window (e.g., days before/after a fixed reference date).
  - Optionally applies normalization, masking, and cropping.
  - Extracts the vineyard label from the `"Classe"` property; the label can be maintained as multiclass or binarized based on a threshold.
  - Serializes sensor data, acquisition dates, and the label into TFRecord examples.
- **Usage Tip:**  
  Adjust the `label_threshold` parameter to control whether the classification should be binary or multiclass.

## Interactive GUI

The library also provides interactive dashboards for both burned area segmentation and vineyard classification:
- **Burned Area Dashboard:**  
  Located in `SatelliteDataManager/analyses/burned_area/burned_area_dashboard.py`. This dashboard enables users to configure download parameters, authenticate with Sentinel Hub, and trigger dataset building and visualization.
- **Vineyard Dashboard:**  
  Located in `SatelliteDataManager/analyses/vineyard/vineyard_dashboard.py`. This dashboard offers similar interactivity for vineyard dataset configuration and visualization.
